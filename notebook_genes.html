  / Shiny 1.4 bumped jQuery from 1.x to 3.x which means jQuery's

  / really means $(setTimeout(fn)).
  / https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/#breaking-change-document-ready-handlers-are-now-asynchronous
  /
  / Since Shiny uses $() to schedule initShiny, shiny>=1.4 calls initShiny
  / one tick later than it did before, which means staticRender() is
  / called renderValue() earlier than (advanced) widget authors might be expecting.
  / https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/issues/2630
  /
  / For a concrete example, leaflet has some methods (e.g., updateBounds)
  / which reference Shiny methods registered in initShiny (e.g., setInputValue).
  / Since leaflet is privy to this life-cycle, it knows to use setTimeout() to
  / delay execution of those methods (until Shiny methods are ready)
  / https://github.com/rstudio/leaflet/blob/18ec981/javascript/src/index.js#L266-L268
  /
  / Ideally widget authors wouldn't need to use this setTimeout() hack that
  / leaflet uses to call Shiny methods on a staticRender(). In the long run,
  / the logic initShiny should be broken up so that method registration happens
  / right away, but binding happens later.

ranges and their prevalence, a graph displaying the frequency of each
range is also included.</p>

<h3 id="distribution-of-the-number-of-transcription-factors-regulating-genes">Distribution
of the Number of Transcription Factors Regulating Genes</h3>
<p>At RegulonDB, we archive detailed information on gene regulation.
Transcription factors (TFs) bind to the promoter region, thereby
regulating the transcriptional unit, which comprises a promoter with
binding sites, a set of transcribed genes, and a terminator region where
the transcription process concludes. This section provides a count of
how many regulators or TFs are involved in the transcription of the
genes.</p>
