  /*
  / Shiny 1.4 bumped jQuery from 1.x to 3.x which means jQuery's
  / on-ready handler (i.e., $(fn)) is now asyncronous (i.e., it now
  / really means $(setTimeout(fn)).
  / https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/#breaking-change-document-ready-handlers-are-now-asynchronous
  /
  / Since Shiny uses $() to schedule initShiny, shiny>=1.4 calls initShiny
  / one tick later than it did before, which means staticRender() is
  / called renderValue() earlier than (advanced) widget authors might be expecting.
  / https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/issues/2630
  /
  / For a concrete example, leaflet has some methods (e.g., updateBounds)
  / which reference Shiny methods registered in initShiny (e.g., setInputValue).
  / Since leaflet is privy to this life-cycle, it knows to use setTimeout() to
  / delay execution of those methods (until Shiny methods are ready)
  / https://github.com/rstudio/leaflet/blob/18ec981/javascript/src/index.js#L266-L268
  /
  / Ideally widget authors wouldn't need to use this setTimeout() hack that
  / leaflet uses to call Shiny methods on a staticRender(). In the long run,
  / the logic initShiny should be broken up so that method registration happens
  / right away, but binding happens later.

<h3 id="sigma-factor-overview">Sigma Factor Overview</h3>
<p>In transcriptional regulation in the bacterium <em>Escherichia
coli</em>, sigma factors play a crucial role in the specificity and
efficiency of gene transcription. Sigma factors are subunits of the RNA
polymerase enzyme that bind to the DNA promoter, initiating the process
of transcription.</p>
<h3 id="sigma-factor-in-e.-coli">Sigma Factor in <em>E. coli</em></h3>
<p><em>E. coli</em> has several sigma factors that differ in their
structure and function. The primary sigma factor in <em>E. coli</em> is
sigma factor 70 (σ70), also known as sigma factor D. This sigma factor
is essential for the majority of transcriptions in E. coli and is
involved in the transcription of constitutive genes or genes expressed
under normal conditions.</p>
<p>In addition to sigma factor 70, E. coli also possesses other specific
sigma factors that regulate gene transcription in response to specific
conditions or stimuli. For instance, sigma factor 32 (σ32) regulates the
expression of heat shock genes in response to heat stress, while sigma
factor 28 (σ28) is involved in the regulation of gene expression in the
stationary phase of bacterial growth.</p>
<p>Sigma factors bind to specific sequences called promoters on the DNA
and recruit the RNA polymerase to initiate transcription. Each sigma
factor recognizes and binds to different promoter sequences, thereby
enabling selective regulation of gene expression in response to specific
environmental conditions or signals.</p>
<p>In summary, sigma factors play a critical role in transcriptional
regulation in <em>E. coli</em> by recognizing and binding to specific
promoter sequences, which allows for precise and selective transcription
of genes in response to environmental conditions and specific signals.
These sigma factors are key elements in the bacterial transcription
machinery and contribute to the adaptability and survival of <em>E.
coli</em> under different environmental conditions.</p>

<h3 id="number-of-regulated-genes-by-sigma-factors-sigmulons">Number of
Regulated genes by Sigma Factor(s) (Sigmulons)</h3>
<p>Sigmulons in E. coli are complex regulatory structures that involve
the coordinated interaction of sigma factors and the expression of
specific genes in response to various environmental conditions or
signals. They can be defined as groups of regulons that share a common
sigma factor, allowing them to coordinate their expression in response
to a common regulatory factor.</p>
<p>Each sigmulon is composed of one or more genes regulated by a
specific sigma factor and a set of DNA binding sites known as consensus
sequences recognized by the sigma factor. These consensus sequences are
recognized and bound by the corresponding sigma factor, recruiting RNA
polymerase and carrying out the transcription of the genes included in
the sigmulon.</p>

<!-- Number of regulated genes per sigma factor -->
<h3 id="number-of-transcription-factors-associated-to-sigma-factors">Number
of Transcription Factors Associated to Sigma Factor(s)</h3>
<p>In the promoter region, besides the RNA polymerase complex with the
accompanying sigma factor, other transcription factors bind to regulate
gene expression. These additional factors are known as specific
transcription factors and play a crucial role in the initiation and
regulation of transcription in different contexts and conditions.</p>
<p>Specific transcription factors bind to specific DNA sequences in the
promoter region and can have various effects on transcription, such as
activation or repression of gene expression. These transcription factors
work in conjunction with RNA polymerase and the sigma factor to
stimulate or repress the transcription of genes.</p>
<p>In E. coli, numerous specific transcription factors have been
identified that interact with the promoter region and contribute to the
regulation of gene expression. These transcription factors can act as
activators, enhancing the ability of RNA polymerase to bind to the
promoter and promote the transcription of specific genes. Similarly,
there are also repressor transcription factors that block or inhibit the
binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter, thereby inhibiting
transcription.</p>
<p>The interaction between these specific transcription factors, RNA
polymerase, and the sigma factor in the promoter region allows for
precise control of gene expression in response to internal and external
signals. This coordination adjusts the cell’s response to different
conditions, adapting to changes in the environment, and optimizing the
expression of genes that are necessary at specific times.</p>

<!-- Number of Transcription Factors Associated to Sigma Factor(s) -->
<h3 id="number-of-promoters-and-tus-associated-to-sigma-factors">Number
of Promoters and TUs Associated to Sigma Factor(s)</h3>
<p>Genes in bacteria, such as E. coli, are often grouped into
transcriptional units (TU). A TU consists of multiple genes arranged
consecutively on the DNA and is transcribed into a single messenger RNA
(mRNA) molecule under the control of a promoter and an operator.</p>
<p>The promoter is the region where RNA polymerase and the sigma factor
complex bind to the DNA to initiate transcription. Sigma factors
recognize specific sequences in the promoter and recruit RNA polymerase
to initiate mRNA synthesis.</p>
